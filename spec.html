        PSDAD (Plaintext Self-Describing Assertional Data) is an
        extensible data serialization format allowing for
        machine-readable data documents which can be reliably
        understood by untrained human readers.

## Introduction

    PSDAD (plaintext self-describing assertional data) is a new [data
serialization format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization).
It is significantly different from [existing
formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_data_serialization_formats),
including XML and JSON, in its use of free-form natural language text
as field and record-type identifiers and simultaneously for schema
definition. PSDAD documents with an appropriate schema can be
understood as natural language text by human readers, while also being
easy for machines to serialize and deserialize. Despite appearances,
there is no [natural language
processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)
(or other "AI") involved, just [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)s.

The design goals, in order of decreasing importance:

1. Decentralized Extensibility. In a shared medium, like the open web,
it should be easy to extend the domain of information being
communicated, adding new features, without negatively impacting any
currently deployed systems and without needing anyone's
permission. Decentralized extensibility has thus far been provided in
a few formats by using UUIDs or URIs, as in XML with namespaces, or
the RDF serializations, like JSON-LD. In psdad, this feature is
provided by just using the schema definition text itself.

2. When using a well-design schema, the meaning of serialized data
should be unambiguous, upon careful inspection, to people without
technical training, such as members of a jury. This meaning should not
depend upon external documents which could be altered to change the
meaning of the serialization. This meanings should also be reasonably
independent of the context in which the serialization was produced,
transmitted, or received, so that it does not change meaning if the
context is lost or misunderstood.

3. Using this serialization should make life easier for software
developers, not harder. Of course, not all developers will find the
same things easier, but it's clear that JSON has significant
advantages on this front over most other serializations. It would be
very hard to compete with JSON on the quick-and-dirty front, but
perhaps the addition of other features, like documentation and
versioning, can provide a system with clear long-term benefit.

4. The average case performance penalty should be linear, without a
decrease in serialization or deserialization speed when handling large
datasets or large schemas.  Hopefully, the worst-case performance
should be no worse than 10x JSON.

5. Serializations should be transmissible with additional encoding
over available human text channels, like email, blog posts, microblogs
(eg twitter, mastodon), and text messaging, so that machine-readable
messages (that is, serializations of data) can use the existing
mechanisms for authenticating people and for authorizing distribution
of messages along existing social connections.
