        PSDAD (Plaintext Self-Describing Assertional Data) is an
        extensible data serialization format designed to support
        machine-readable data documents which can be reliably
        understood by untrained human readers.

## Introduction

    PSDAD (plaintext self-describing assertional data) is a new [data
serialization format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization).
It is significantly different from [existing
formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_data_serialization_formats),
including XML and JSON, in its use of free-form natural language text
as field and record-type identifiers and simultaneously for schema
definition. PSDAD documents with an appropriate schema can be
understood as natural language text by human readers, while also being
easy for machines to serialize and deserialize. Despite appearances,
there is no [natural language
processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)
(or other "AI") involved, just [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)s.

The design goals, in order of decreasing importance:

1. The design needs to allow evolution-in-place. The initial release
will be necessarily have many shortcomings, for instance in
internationalization. As such, it must be clear how compatible future
releases, possibly with syntactic extensions, can be deployed in
practice.

1. Decentralized Extensibility. In a shared medium, like the open web,
it should be easy to extend the domain of information being
communicated, adding new features, without negatively impacting any
currently deployed systems and without needing anyone's
permission. Decentralized extensibility has thus far been provided in
a few formats by using UUIDs or URIs, as in XML with namespaces, or
the RDF serializations, like JSON-LD. In psdad, this feature is
provided by just using the schema definition text itself.

1. When using a well-design schema, the meaning of serialized data
should be unambiguous, upon careful inspection, to people without
technical training, such as members of a jury. This meaning should not
depend upon external documents which could be altered to change the
meaning of the serialization. This meanings should also be reasonably
independent of the context in which the serialization was produced,
transmitted, or received, so that it does not change meaning if the
context is lost or misunderstood.

1. Using this serialization should make life easier for software
developers, not harder. Of course, not all developers will find the
same things easier, but it's clear that JSON has significant
advantages on this front over most other serializations. It would be
very hard to compete with JSON on the quick-and-dirty front, but
perhaps the addition of other features, like documentation and
versioning, can provide a system with clear long-term benefit.

1. The average case performance penalty should be linear, without a
decrease in serialization or deserialization speed when handling large
datasets or large schemas.  Hopefully, the worst-case performance
should be no worse than 10x JSON.

1. Serializations should be transmissible with additional encoding
over available human text channels, like email, blog posts, microblogs
(eg twitter, mastodon), and text messaging, so that machine-readable
messages (that is, serializations of data) can use the existing
mechanisms for authenticating people and for authorizing distribution
of messages along existing social connections.

## Processing Model

PSDAD **producers** are systems which contain data in their native data
respresentation and in order to send it to other systems, they
serialize it using some psdad schema, producing a character string
which represents the data. That string may be written to a file or
transmitted, usually using utf8. We use the term "string" in the
abstract sense of a sequence of characters; it can be streamed and
does not need to fit in memory.

PSDAD **consumers** are system which read a string, using a PSDAD
schema, and convert it into a native data representation for use in
some application.

When producers and consumers are using the same schema and the same
native data representations, the consumer should end up with a
faithful copy of the data the producer intended to transmit.

More importantly, the schemas and representations can be different in
useful ways and the transmission remains faithful under normal
circumstances. In particular, a producer can encode data multiple
different ways (typically old "compatibility" versions and new
"extended" versions) and a consumer will automatically ignore types of
content and versions which are not useful for its application
purposes.

In some situations, it is practical for the schema to be negotiated.
For example, during an HTTP GET of a dataset representation from a
server process, the client might include a "Prefer" header or query
parameter in which it provides a URL for the schema it will be using
to read the data.  Given that, the producer can limit its output to
the intersections of its schema and the client's, avoiding unnecessary
data transfer and processing at both ends.

This document specifies how conformant PSDAD Consumers turn strings
into an internal data representation for use by applications. It also
defines how conformant PSDAD Producers behave, generally by
implication as whatever is necessary for the consumer to reproduce the
data the consumer was intending to transmit.

Processing is defined in three independent stages. Simple applications
can we written using only the first stage.

1. data **parsing**: using template declarations in the application data
   schema, convert the overall psdoc string into a set of records,
   where each record is a mapping from slot-name to slot-string.

2. data **binding**: using slot declarations in the schema, convert each
   slot-string into a native data value. This conversion includes
   handling conventional datatypes like numbers and dates, as well more
   complicated handling of structured values and references (links)
   between them.

3. data **validation**: this optional stage uses additional slot
   declaractions to perform various checks, so that application code
   can safely assume data values it encounters will be as expected.

### Schemas

A PSDAD schema consists of a sequence of templates.  Each template
consists of a sequence of parts, where each part is either a "literal"
or a "slot". Literals are just strings. Slots are entities with
various properties, such as a name and type, depending on context.

Schemas, templates, and slots may have platform-dependent data
attached, such as bindings to relevant application-defined classes, or
transformation functions to execute when reading or writing data.

As an example, consider a fictional producer of weather data,
TempScan.  TempScan has a set of weather stations and publishes a feed
of automated observations. In our example, they are using the psdad.js
library, so they define their schema using calls to its API like this:

<pre class="example" title="Schema for TempScan data (as psdad.js code)">
const sch = new psdad.Schema()
shc.add(TempReading, 'The temperature at station [station] was [temp]C at time [timestamp].')
sch.add(WindReading, 'At station [station] the windspeed was [speed]k/h at time [timestamp].')
</pre>

In this example, TempReading and WindReading are application
classes. The library uses a notation where each template appears as
a concatenation of its literals and slots, where the slot name appears
in square brackets.

In JSON, one might represent that same schema, without the class
names, like this:

<pre class="example" title="Schema for TempScan data (in JSON)">
[
  [
    "The temperature at station ",
    { "name": "station" },
    " was ",
    { "name": "temp" },
    "C at time ",
    { "name": "timestamp" },
    "."
  ],
  [
    "At station ",
    { "name": "station" },
    " the windspeed was ",
    { "name": "speed" },
    "k/h at time ",
    { "name": "timestamp" },
    "."
  ]
]
</pre>

The first template in this example schema consists of the following
elements, in order:

1. The literal `"The temperature at station "` (note the space at the end of the string)
1. A slot (slot 0, named "station")
1. The literal `" was "` (note the spaces at the beginning and end of the string)
1. A slot (slot 1, named "temp")
1. The literal `" C at time "`
1. A slot (slot 2, named "timestamp")
1. The literal `"."`

ISSUE: Define a serialization syntax for schemas, for that above use
case where the client tells the server its schema. This would be
excellent dogfood.

## Data Parsing

We use the term "data parsing" to refer to the process of converting
an input string of characters (a PSDAD document) into a sequence of
data records.  In our model, a data record is a set of property-value
bindings, similar to a JSON object or a CSV row (if you consider CSV
headings to be property names), where the values are strings.

The inverse operation to parsing, "coding" (also called serializing,
marshalling, or stringifying), is implicitly defined by how we define
parsing.  A conformant PSDAD coder, encoding a sequence of data
records R, MUST produce produce a string which would be parsed by any
conformant PSDAD parser to produce an identical copy of R (if using
the same schema).

PSDAD parsing is dependent on a schema. Unlike with JSON and XML,
parsing without a schema is not possible. The schema used in parsing a
string does not, however, need to exactly the match the schema used to
produce the string. Instead, data should be coded and parsed using
whatever schema is appropriate for the application at the time.

A PSDAD schema consists of a sequence of templates, where each
template is a sequence elements which are each either a literal string
or a slot. For the purposes parsing, the slots have no properties and
can simply be identifed by an index, like "slot 0" for the first slot.
The later section [Data Binding](#Data_Binding) covers slot
properties.

As an example, consider a fictional producer of weather data,
TempScan.  TempScan has a set of weather stations and publishes a feed
of the data they collect.  They might use a schema like this:

<pre class="example" title="Schema for TempScan data">
[1] The temperature at station [] was []C at time [].
[2] At station [] the windspeed was []k/h at time [].
</pre>

In this example, slots have been shown as empty bracket expressions
(like "[]"). In practice, information about the slot will usually
appear inside the brackets.

The first template in this example schema consists of the following
elements, in order:

1. The literal "The temperature at station "
1. A slot (slot 0)
1. The literal " was "
1. A slot (slot 1)
1. The literal " C at time "
1. A slot (slot 2)
1. The literal "."

This might be used to parse some data:

<pre class="example" title="Some TempScan data">
This is TempScan dataset 3321.

The temperature at station 7 was 21.2C at time 2019-01-01T11:11:38-05:00.
At station 7 the windspeed was 0.4k/h at time 2019-01-01T11:11:38-05:00.
The temperature at station 9 was 21.2C at time 2019-01-01T11:11:38-05:00.
</pre>

Templates must not contain adjacent slots and must not end with a slot.  Parsers MUST reject any schema violating this condition.

The parsing rules are:

1. The quote character (") U+0022 marks the beginning of a "quoted string", which continues until the matching end-quote. Any characters may occur in between, with backslash (\) U+005C being used to escape any quote characters inside the string, and itself, as in JSON.  In the current version, no other escape sequences are allowed and parsers MUST reject strings which use them.

1. All whitespace in the input outside of quoted strings is converted into a single space character ( ) U+0020 before matching.  Whitespace inside quoted strings remains unchanged.

1. Template matching is attempted at each character position in the input.

1. If multiple templates match at that position, the one which
matching the most characters is used.

1. If multiple templates match at a position, and they match the same
number of characters of the input string, then the matching template
is the one which occurs earliest in the schema.

1. A template matches a substring S of the input text when each of its
literals and slots matches consecutive substrings of S, and either the
input ends or the next character is a space.

1. A literal L matches a substring S of the input if L and S consist
of exactly the string.

1. A slot matches either a quoted string or the shortest possible
substring of the input which enables the literal which follows the
slot in its template to match.

1. When a template matches a substring, that text is consumed, and
matching proceeds onward.  Matches do not overlap.

1. Input text which does not match by these rules is ignored.

The slot matching rule is key.  It means that the literal after a slot
acts as the delimiter of the slot. In writing PSDAD text, to enable
correct parsing, one must use quoted string when that delimiter occurs
in the slot's intended text,

These rules are believed to be suitable for parsing with a DFA, such
as used by typical regular-expression engines.

BUG: current manual-parse code will skip over a shorter-earlier template

Parsers MAY have a "strict mode" which rejects input with non-matching
input, rather than ignoring it, for use in contexts where decentralized
extensibility is not appropriate.

### Test Suite

A portion of the data-parsing test suite appears here.  (Maybe: The suite
itself is serialized here using psdad.)

Let s1 refer to the following schema:

A PSDAD data parser using 

## Data Binding

### General

ISSUE: how to parse apart the type and name and other features?  Maybe it's:
* [name]
* [name, type name-of-type]
* [name, one of ("a", "b", "c")]
* [type name]     [int age]
* [name: type]    [age: int]   [age :int]
* [type: name]    [int: age]

Datatype vs class?  In any case it's NATIVE type names.

* [age, js number, c int]

That type and constraint information is used:

1. in validation during serialization or parsing
1. in input data binding to convert to suitable native types
1. in output data binding, when native value has multiple interfaces or isn't available for inspeaction
1. to communicate out-of-band to people using your data how you produce it, to make it easier for them to consume it

Once you publish an output schema, you should only *add* to it, and
mark things as deprecated, but never change or remove.

But do we also need XSD datatype information?  What if there are two
different types with the same serialization?  Doesn't happen much.
Timestamps without timezeon meaning Z vs local?

### Datatypes

Slots contain lexical representations of data values.  The mapping
from a set of strings to the values represented by each string is
called a datatype.  For example, using the datatype "number" the
string "3" maps to the number three, while using the datatype
"string", the string "3" simply maps to itself.

Datatypes are *not* used for [data parsing](#Data_Parsing). Instead,
they are part of [data binding](#Data_Binding), allowing the
application develop to use datatypes suitable for their environment.

One implication of this is that template text must be used to encode
any important datatype information, rather than reyling on the system
to convey this information. This is somewhat like [duck
typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing) in programming
languages.

For example:

* TempScan uses integer mmhg presure measurements: "The pressure at station [] is [:int32]."
* QuickWeather reads it with "The pressure at station [] is [:float]."

That's fine.  No problem.  But if:

* TempScan writes with "The pressure at station [] is [:float]."
* QuickWeather reads it with "The pressure at station [] is [:int32]."

then things will be fine until TempScan actually uses a non-integer
value, in which case QuickWeather's datatype handler will have to
either throw an error or perform a lossy conversion (perhaps by
rounding).

ISSUE:

To avoid this issue, which could be much more serious, the template
literals can encode information about datatype:

* "The pressure at station [] is [:number] (64bit IEEE 754, like 2.9e+8)"

This is an example of where the templates can get cumbersome, as we're
embedding the relevant parts of the authoring schema.

Actually, this is a bad idea.  Don't do it.  Because what if you want
to change it later?  What are you really saying?  You're saying in one
statement that future statements will be a certain way?  Ehhh.

----

Move this to before data binding.

* Data Parsing:   input-text + schema => parse tree, [ {tid1, s0, s1, ...}, {... } ... ]
* Data Typing: slot-text + slot parameters => slot-value, in native representation (opt use strings)
* Data Binding: combine those into application classes (option, use {} + [])

----

tagging data types, eg hex vs decimal, because which is '10'?

----

strict parsing, initiated by header

This text contains a section which is likely to be misunderstood if
not read and understood in sequential order. If any part of it is read
without understanding all previous parts, the entire section may be
significantly misunderstood.  If you understand this, you may read the
text which follows, between the start and end markers. It has been
modified so that it is less likely to be accidentally read out of
order; the modification is that the unicode code points of each
character has been incremented; to read it, you must decrement the code
points. <text begins here>[text]<text ends here>.

----

Not sure about the whitespace rules.  Does it apply inside slot-text?

If whitespace inside slot text is transformed, then we'll need to
quote any text that happens to include a newline.  What if it's two
paragraphs?  How would that be transmitted??

---

Lists are a datatype.  Might be serialized several ways.  We have a
list.  For input and output, each of which gets tried.

eg JSON, markdown, and my [1] thing, which works better if we've lost
newlines.

123,456  inus vs eu

headers?  key-to-understanding-0this-document?

ref to key in msg?

* reading is 123,456 [see notes]
* reading is 123.456 [see note-7]
